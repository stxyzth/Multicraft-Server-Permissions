# Multicraft Server Permissions
Fix the Minecraft server permissions on a Linux box running the Minecraft server control panel "Multicraft"



Instructions:

1. Download or copy the script.
2. Move it to the main server directory, usually "/home/minecraft/multicraft/servers/".
3. Run the script
4. Check permissions to make sure it completed successfully. Then remove the script from the folder.


Report any bugs to me if there are any problems. This is a script made in less than a minute to solve a recurring issue I had been having, I'm sure there are better ways to go about fixing the issue but this one works just fine.
